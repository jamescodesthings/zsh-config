# Current Session State & Handoff

- **Active Tool:** Claude Code CLI
- **Date/Time Stamp:** 2026-09-20 17:06 BST
- **Current Task Status:** `update` is solid: the user confirmed the sudo isolation and a clean full run on 2026-09-20. `update --errors` now answers for the last run, and `020-mas` re-indexes apps Spotlight lost (6917761, pushed). Next is the user's pass over the three research docs.

## Milestone & Phase Progress

- [x] Project init against agent-forge (baseline: changelog entry 2026-09-07)
- [x] VS Code: ShellCheck off for Bash IDE, `ctrl+alt+z` runs `zsh -n` on the current file
- [x] `.cache/` ignored
- [x] `900-agent-forge` updater (git pull, `make install`, fails on non-zero exit or a `[warn]` line)
- [x] No-prompt audit of every updater and of agent-forge's `make install` path
- [x] sudo authenticated once at the start of `update`, with a keepalive
- [x] Updaters renumbered big to little, wrapped in braces, nine new ones added
- [x] Research doc written and its top claim (duplicate `compinit`) checked
- [x] Consistency check over readme, cheatsheets and agent instructions (44b89b2)
- [x] Per-run error log for `update`, reprinted at the end, newest 20 kept (840846b)
- [x] macOS dev workflow R&D: `docs/macos-workflow-rnd-2026-09-19.md`, 21 ranked items
- [x] Obsidian alternatives R&D: `docs/obsidian-alternatives-rnd-2026-09-19.md` (top pick Things 3 plus Apple Notes, runner-up Logseq, or stay on Obsidian with three changes)
- [ ] User to choose a route from the Obsidian doc
- [ ] User to choose items from the macOS workflow doc
- [ ] User to choose which ranks from the improvements doc to apply
- [x] First full `update` runs with real sudo (2026-09-20 11:10 and 15:17)
- [x] Fixes from those runs: brew sudo reset isolated, agent-forge benign warn no longer a failure, mas Spotlight warnings folded, bun's `.zshrc` edit made portable (3cb50b4)
- [x] User confirmed the sudo isolation (`survived`) and a clean full run with one sudo prompt
- [x] `update --errors` answers for the last run; `020-mas` indexes unindexed apps with `mdimport` (6917761)

## Next Steps

- Reading order given to the user for the research docs: improvements (ranked table, then sections 1 to 6), Obsidian alternatives (Recommendation section only), macOS workflow (ranked table, then ranks 1 to 9).
- `020-mas`'s `mdimport` step has only been tested with fakes; the next macOS upgrade is its first real test.
- agent-forge backs up and relinks Antigravity's `settings.json` on every install. That belongs in the agent-forge repo.
